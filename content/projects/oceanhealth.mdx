## Overview

Alongside two other students, I am developing an AI-powered web assistant that lets people ask complex questions about the ocean using plain language.

## Why This Matters

Environmental data is still hard to interpret and difficult to access for many communities, educators, and even some researchers. Our goal is to make ocean data **searchable, understandable, and usable** for anyone.

## What Weâ€™re Building

This is an active research project. We're creating a **GenAI assistant** that:

- Uses **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)** to combine large language models with trusted ocean datasets
- Pulls data from multiple sources including **ONC's Oceans 3.0 API** and other datasets that Open AI does not have access to

## Status

We're in early development, focusing on engineering requirements, and options for our stack.
This system is part of broader research at **SOLIDS Lab** exploring ocean health and how technology can support ocean literacy and future policy decisions to protect marine ecosystems.
