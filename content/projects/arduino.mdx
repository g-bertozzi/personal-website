Developed AVR assembly program for an  Mega2560 to control a hexadecimal counter on a 2x16 LCD using button inputs, enabling digit manipulation across five positions on the display. Utilized multiple 16-bit timers in coordination with interrupt handlers for button press detection and screen display, and implemented timer-based polling to ensure reliable display updates. Built a modular solution across multiple project phases with functionality even in partially completed segments.
