Developed Python-based control logic for FortisBC’s biogas system expansion, using pressure sensor data from Excel inputs to simulate and manage PSA vessel pressures, supporting a 60% plant capacity increase.
Built an interactive web app using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and Javascript to visualize real-time gas flows and vessel states, improving accessibility for non-technical users.
