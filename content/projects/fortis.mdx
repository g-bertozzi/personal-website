## What We Built

To support **FortisBC**’s expansion of its Glendale landfill gas recycling plant, I led the developement of a **Python** based control system for multiple vessels in the system expansion, that safely manages dynamic gas flows while ensuring steady biogas production.

I led a Controls subteam of five students as part of UVic’s Women in Engineering, Science & Tech consulting project with FortisBC, collaborating with ~30 students across mechanical, electrical, civil, and project management teams. Our objective was to build a system expansion to support a projected 60% increase in landfill gas intake by 2030.

## How I Contributed

### Control Logic Architecture  
I broke down engineering diagrams and system requirements, then helped lead the design of a 12-condition control logic system, outlining safe operating thresholds for valves, vessels, and compressors. I personally implemented several functions in our **modular, object-oriented Python** program that allowed future conditions to be added easily.

### Real-World Data Simulation  
To simulate behavior under realistic conditions, I independently learned `pandas` and co-developed a **sensor data parser** that transformed historical Excel files into usable inputs for our control logic. This allowed us to test the system against realistic pressure scenarios.

### Simulation Interface  
I also initiated and pair programmed a **system simluation** to visual gas flow and pressure throughout system vessels, using **HTML**, **CSS Tailwind**, and **Javascript**.

## Results

We delivered a modular Python program for two conditions with a live code demo and a functioning system simulation to a pannel of industry professionals and an audience of 100.

## Leadership

As a senior team member, I focused not only on building reliable code but also on fostering a space where younger students felt supported and able to contribute confidently. I made it a priority to ensure all members felt comfortable asking questions, and in turn, learnt a tremendous amount from all of my teammates.

## Takeaways 

This project pushed me technically and interpersonally. I strengthened my ability to:

- Independently learn and apply new concepts
- Navigate amgbuity and real world requirements
- Communicate clearly across multi-functional and non-technical audiences
