Built command line tool using Python, integrated with a C-based text processing program, enabling users to search contents of many text files from the command line.
Developed a processing pipeline in C to handle streamed input, including parsing and cleaning text, indexing words based on frequency, and generating a term frequency matrix to model data across multiple files.
Utilized the term frequency matrix to deliver ranked search results for files based on user-specified search terms.
