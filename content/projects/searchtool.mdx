Created a command-line program taking a text query from user and returning most relevant documents from the input directory. Designed a processing pipeline to filter stop words, followed by an indexing tool to extract and analyze relevant term frequency data, and finally a h tool to output a list of files from input directory ranked by vector similarity to the query vector.
